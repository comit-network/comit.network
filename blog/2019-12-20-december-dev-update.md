December, the silent time of the year, was not that silent for us.
By the end of November the CoBloX team was flying out to Singapore for Christmas at the TenX office. 
We had a wonderful time in Singapore meeting up with colleagues from all over the world.

We invested quite some time into [create-comit-app](https://github.com/comit-network/create-comit-app) before our hackathon on 08.12.2019.
Two things shall be mentioned specifically:
1. [create-comit-app](https://github.com/comit-network/create-comit-app) was [released for Windows](https://github.com/comit-network/create-comit-app/releases),
2. the code base of [create-comit-app](https://github.com/comit-network/create-comit-app) was refactored to use Rust's async await. 

Although our hackathon was a smaller event than originally planned we had a good time with the people that showed up. 
The [kick-off presentation video](https://youtu.be/vjxZTRtgWg8) which explains the essentials of atomic swaps using HTLCs and COMIT can be found in our recently created [COMIT Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGfRErNHqtEn62HJz56UiLQ).

The events in Switzerland and Austria went really well. 
Presenting COMIT at different locations in Zurich, Zug, Vienna and Hagenberg allowed us to validate some of our assumptions and discuss the state of the current implementation.
We had an especially good discussion around cross-blockchain solutions in general and atomic swaps in particular at the [Bitcoin Austria meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Bitcoin-Austria/events/266381417/) in Vienna, where we presented together with [Pantos](https://pantos.io/) and had a small podium discussion. 
Doing all these events is a great motivation for the start into the new year.

With the events of the old year being over we already have some planned for 2020.
From the first quarter of 2020 onwards we will stream our quarterly dev-updates live on the [COMIT Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGfRErNHqtEn62HJz56UiLQ).
Join us for the first dev-update live-stream on Jitsi:
* **[COMIT Community ☕️](https://meet.jit.si/COMIT-Community-Coffee-01-2020)** on Saturday, **January 11 - 8pm Sydney time**.
* The Jitsi meeting will be [streamed on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo2-6XPB1M4) (non-interactive).

Next events planned in 2020:
* [Advancing Bitcoin conference](https://www.advancingbitcoin.com/) and [London Bitcoin Week](http://www.londonbitcoinweek.com/), London in the beginning of February,
* [Financial Crypto](http://fc20.ifca.ai/cfp.html) conference in Malaysia, February 10-14.

Thomas and Philipp will be at these events to answer questions around COMIT and cross-blockchain solutions. 

Happy new year - and happy hacking,

— Daniel
