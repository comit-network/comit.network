[Join us for the next COMIT Community ☕️](https://meet.jit.si/COMIT-Community-Coffee-04-2020) today, 7pm Sydney time, or listen in on [youtube](https://youtu.be/DHbGsf9i8TM)!

On today's community coffee we will reflect on the first quarter of this year with a focus on Lightning Network (layer 2) integration into COMIT.
We will discuss advantages and possible pitfalls. 
Furthermore, we will discuss decentralised order-book solutions and what we want to tackle in the second quarter.

<!--truncate-->

We are moving fast.
But sometimes things need time - the Lightning integration into the COMIT core is almost done... and will be finished shortly.
In order to speed things up for integrating Lightning we now have a squad of three people working on that task only.
With the focus squad you can be expected within the next week.
Once the [Lightning integration epic](https://github.com/coblox/admin/issues/158) is closed it's done! Stay tuned.

The [proof of concept for Grin-BTC swaps](https://github.com/comit-network/grin-btc-poc) was successfully finished by the end of March.
We are not moving on to integrating the solution outlined in th proof of concept into the core of COMIT.
We are already very excited on integrating privacy preserving swaps as new protocol powered by scriptless scripts.

We started investing time using our own tools to improve them and learn from them.
You can have a first glimpse of the results of a [BTC-DAI swap app prototype](https://github.com/comit-network/app).

The documentation is still improving on our homepage.
Additionally the homepage will soon get a new improved start-page. Stay tuned!

Happy hacking,

— Daniel
