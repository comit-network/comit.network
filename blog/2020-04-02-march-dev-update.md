[Join us for the next COMIT Community ☕️](https://meet.jit.si/COMIT-Community-Coffee-04-2020) today, 7pm Sydney time, or listen in on [youtube](https://youtu.be/DHbGsf9i8TM)!

On today's community coffee we will reflect on the first quarter of this year with a focus on Lightning Network (layer 2) integration into COMIT.
We will discuss technical challenges we encountered.
Furthermore, we will discuss what we are planning to tackle in the second quarter, including decentralised order-book solutions.

We are moving fast.
But sometimes things need time - the Lightning integration into the COMIT core is almost done... and will be finished soon.
In order to speed things up for integrating Lightning we now have a squad of three people working on that task only.
With the focus squad you can be expected within the next week.
Once the [Lightning integration epic](https://github.com/coblox/admin/issues/158) is closed it's done! Stay tuned.

The [proof of concept for Grin-BTC swaps](https://github.com/comit-network/grin-btc-poc) was successfully finished by the end of March.
We are now moving on to integrating the solution outlined in the proof of concept into cnd.
We are very excited to be getting close to having privacy preserving swaps powered by scriptless scripts in COMIT.

Throughout this last quarter we also invested time into using our own [app development](https://github.com/comit-network/create-comit-app) [tools](https://github.com/comit-network/comit-js-sdk), to improve them and learn from them.
You can have a first glimpse of the results of a [BTC-DAI swap app prototype](https://github.com/comit-network/app).

The documentation is still improving on our homepage.
Additionally the homepage will soon get a new and improved landing page. Keep on staying tuned!

Happy hacking,

— Daniel
