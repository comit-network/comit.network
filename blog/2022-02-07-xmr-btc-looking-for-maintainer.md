Help welcome! 
If you love the XMR-BTC swap tool, have some Rust knowledge and are willing to step up please reach out for becoming a maintainer.
It'd be great if community members could step in to keep this project alive.
Unfortunately, we currently don't have the capacity.

As always you reach us on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#comit-monero:matrix.org) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/comit_network).

## You love XMR and BTC? You know Rust? Become a maintainer!

As much as we enjoyed building XMR-BTC swaps, we don't have the capacity to maintain the project.
We are currently partnering with ItchySats building trustless CFD trading using DLCs on Bitcoin.
This requires all of our brainpower and time. 
We tried to fix XMR-BTC swap tool issues by the side, but it's not working out well.
Issues are piling up, dependencies get more and more outdated and user request are being unheard.

Reaching out to the community: 
If you love the XMR-BTC swap tool, have some Rust knowledge and are willing to step up please reach out and we are happy to discuss making you a maintainer.

As always you reach us on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#comit-monero:matrix.org) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/comit_network).

Cheers,
The COMIT guys
