COMIT's mission is to have an open financial system - truly inclusive, censorship resistant and non-discriminatory. Such a financial system has to allow for exchange of funds between different market participants such as investors, lenders and borrowers in a trustless manner. Liquid [1] seems to be a promising platform for such marketplaces as it has built-in support for different assets in a single transaction while keeping amounts, addresses and assets confidential. These features used in combination allow us to create trustless and private atomic swaps, trustless loans and other financial products.

## Confidential Atomic Swaps on Liquid

We are kicking-off a new project to look into Liquid's transaction format which would allow us to do true atomic swaps between two assets. This would allow us to have true trustless BTC/USD (using L-BTC and L-USDT) while all amounts, assets and addresses are confidential. This is huge as it is one step closer to a truly trustless and censorship resistant financial system. 

If deemed useful, this might be the start of a longer series of R&D projects focusing on Blockstream's sidechain Liquid.

We are not the only one who found interest in Liquid: Cryptogarage is known for its research on bitcoin and has recently launched SETTLENET - a DEX on Liquid [2] and HodlHodl has started a product for lending on Liquid [3]. 

We are super excited about this, so stay tuned.
