// TODO: Explain what this file is about and the goal of the tutorial (3-4 Sentences).

This is a typescript tutorial for creating your first COMIT-app. 
In this tutorial we build a simple command-line application that uses the COMIT protocol to execute an atomic swap locally on your machine between Bitcoin and Ethereum.

// TODO: Reduce the introduction
## Introduction

The goal of the tutorial is to have a simple command-line application that handles the negotiation and execution of an atomic swap for both sides of a trade.

For the negotiation phase we introduce two roles, the maker and the taker. The maker creates orders and publishes them. The taker takes orders published by the maker.
In this tutorial our maker has Bitcoin and wants Ether. Our taker has Ether and wants Bitcoin.

This tutorial uses the comit-js-sdk's [TakerNegotiator]() and [MakerNegotiator]() classes for negotiating the trade. 
This tutorial does not tackle the problem of "finding a trading partner".
It is assumed that the taker already knows how to reach the "order-server" of the maker.


When it comes to the execution of the swap there are also two roles, Alice and Bob, that represent the cryptographic roles of the swap protocol. 
Alice is the role that comes up with the secret. She funds and redeems first. Bob is the role that receives the secret hash from Alice prior to swap execution.
After the negotiation the taker will default to the role of Alice. The maker will default to Bob. 
This means that Alice (the taker) has to fund on the Ethereum side and redeem Bob's (the maker) Bitcoin.
Bob funds the Bitcoin side and redeems Alice's Ether.

Let's jump right into the setup.

## Setup

In the [previous section about comit-scripts](../getting-started/comit-scripts.md) we took a look on how to use comit-scripts to setup your development environment.
The same setup is used for this tutorial.

For getting started please create a new project using the `create` command of create-comit-app:

```
yarn create comit-app my-first-comit-app
```

Navigate into the newly created `my-first-comit-app` folder and start the development environment:

```
cd my-first-comit-app
yarn install && yarn start-env
```

An Ethereum `parity`, a Bitcoin `bitcoind`, one `cnd` node for the maker and one `cnd` node for the taker are now started.
Keep the development environment running in this terminal!

### Understanding the environment

The environment created through comit-scripts (`start-env`) gives you pre-funded accounts that we will use in this tutorial.
All variables related to the environment are stored in the `${HOME}/.create-comit-app/env` file.

In your project folder you find an `index.js` file that is currently the entry point for running the application.
Open a new terminal and run:
```shell script
yarn start
```

This will print the environment information of the dev-environment started through `start-env`:

```
Environment configuration:
Bitcoin HD keys:
1.  tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPfARyVrLY2LGqCxi7EgzMQP5eLtQ6izLiCD52vdHMxgFc9VhFzfvur9nndNFdJnwF46nPWcEbf64bYp9pK23abbxjfPEyBNi
2.  tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPdAY3E7VwbiH9gc9GCRNAew7R6UMW1J4m1tfYXkxctDZJba88BvtFnaJQyDTZm9dxBrz2w3BmEBcTCMPnuWPG6hhntu3gEoG
Bitcoin node P2P URI:  127.0.0.1:52879
Ethereum private keys:
1.  34e64385ef7c9dfab1bb8d0015b263e4b15b76afc3535af0a9ed0584ae49024d
2.  06354eef150a1909cf1f414c5888f6d762ecbd9bca247de4ba534fd66481d36e
Ethereum node HTTP URL:  http://127.0.0.1:52369
ERC20 token contract address:  0x62d69f6867a0a084c6d313943dc22023bc263691
cnd HTTP API URLs:
1.  http://127.0.0.1:53129
2.  http://127.0.0.1:53164
```

By default `start-env` will create two accounts for both Bitcoin and Ethereum and find them.
Initial funding is **10 BTC** and **1000 ETH**.
We will use these accounts for our maker and taker when creating the maker and taker COMIT-apps. 

Additionally `start-env` creates an ERC20 contract for swapping from/to ERC20 tokens. This is not relevant for this tutorial.

The connection information for the Bitcoin node, Ethereum node and the two cnd nodes is printed as well.

### Typescript configuration

The example generated by create-comit-app is pure Javascript.
We have to configure Typescript in order to use it in our project.

Open the `package.json` and add these two lines in the `devDependencies` section:

```json
"ts-node": "^8.6.2",
"typescript": "^3.7.5",
```

### Prepare Maker and Taker app

Since the goal of this tutorial is to have the maker and taker run separately, we need one file that will represent the COMIT-app of the maker and one for the taker.
We will use typescript in this tutorial.

Let's create two files in the project directory `my-first-comit-app`:

1. `maker.ts` for the COMIT-app representing the maker
2. `taker.ts` for the COMIT-app representing the taker

Both apps will be runnable command line applications, so let's add a main function to `maker.ts`:

```$typescript
(async function main() {
    console.log("COMIT Maker app");
    process.exit();
})();
```

and `taker.ts`:

```$typescript
(async function main() {
    console.log("COMIT Taker app");
    process.exit();
})();
```

Additionally we have to add commands to run these two actors in the `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  ...
  "maker": "ts-node ./src/maker.ts",
  "taker": "ts-node ./src/taker.ts",
  ...
}
```

With this in place we can already run our maker app:

```shell script
yarn run maker
```

and taker app:
```shell script
yarn run taker
```

### Initialising the actors

In this section we use the [Actor](../comit-sdk/interfaces/_actor_.actor.md) interface of the comit-sdk to initialise the maker and taker actors.
We will use the Bitcoin and Ethereum accounts created through `start-env` for initialising the actors.

Through the actor we have access to the wallets and the [ComitClient](../comit-sdk/classes/_comit_client_.comitclient.md) which is used as a wrapper for the communication with cnd.  

#### Initialise the maker app

Let's focus on the maker for the beginning.
`start-env` has provided us with two Bitcoin and two Ethereum accounts indexed with `0` and `1`.
Let's use the Bitcoin and Ethereum account indexed with `0` for the maker.

From the `index.js` file we already know how to load the environment using the `dotenv` package:

```typescript
const configPath = path.join(os.homedir(), ".create-comit-app", "env");
dotenv.config({path: configPath});
```

First we initialise the Bitcoin wallet using the `InMemoryBitcoinWallet` provided by the comit-sdk:
```typescript
    const bitcoinWallet = await InMemoryBitcoinWallet.newInstance(
        "regtest",
        process.env.BITCOIN_P2P_URI!,
        process.env[`BITCOIN_HD_KEY_${0}`]!
    );
    // Waiting for the Bitcoin wallet to read the balance
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000));
```

Then we initialise the `EthereumWallet` provided bt the comit-sdk:

```typescript
    const ethereumWallet = new EthereumWallet(
            process.env.ETHEREUM_NODE_HTTP_URL!,
            process.env[`ETHEREUM_KEY_${0}`]!
        );
```

Now we can use the `createActor` helper function of the comit-sdk to intialise the actor.

```typescript
let maker = await createActor(
        bitcoinWallet,
        ethereumWallet,
        process.env[`HTTP_URL_CND_${0}`]!
    );
```

Let's print the balance of the maker to see how much BTC and ETH he has before the swap:

```typescript
console.log(
        "[Maker] Bitcoin balance: %f, Ether balance: %f",
        (await maker.bitcoinWallet.getBalance()).toFixed(2),
        parseFloat(
            formatEther(await maker.ethereumWallet.getBalance())
        ).toFixed(2)
    );
```

Note that we are using the `formatEther` function from `ethers/utils` to format the ether properly.

Your `maker.ts` file should now look like this:

```typescript
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
import * as os from "os";
import * as path from "path";
import {createActor, EthereumWallet, InMemoryBitcoinWallet} from "comit-sdk";
import { formatEther } from "ethers/utils";

(async function main() {
    console.log("COMIT Maker app");

    const configPath = path.join(os.homedir(), ".create-comit-app", "env");
    dotenv.config({path: configPath});

    const bitcoinWallet = await InMemoryBitcoinWallet.newInstance(
        "regtest",
        process.env.BITCOIN_P2P_URI!,
        process.env[`BITCOIN_HD_KEY_${0}`]!
    );
    // Waiting for the Bitcoin wallet to read the balance
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000));

    const ethereumWallet = new EthereumWallet(
        process.env.ETHEREUM_NODE_HTTP_URL!,
        process.env[`ETHEREUM_KEY_${0}`]!
    );

    let maker = await createActor(
        bitcoinWallet,
        ethereumWallet,
        process.env[`HTTP_URL_CND_${0}`]!
    );

    console.log(
        "[Maker] Bitcoin balance: %f, Ether balance: %f",
        (await maker.bitcoinWallet.getBalance()).toFixed(2),
        parseFloat(
            formatEther(await maker.ethereumWallet.getBalance())
        ).toFixed(2)
    );

    process.exit();
})();
```

When running `yarn run maker` you should see:

```
yarn run v1.22.0
$ ts-node ./src/maker.ts
COMIT Maker app
[Maker] Bitcoin balance: 10, Ether balance: 1000
✨  Done in 7.19s.
```

#### Initialise the taker app

For the taker we will have a similar setup as for the maker. (This could of course be pulled out into a library later.)

Similar to the maker we will load the Bitcoin and Ethereum account from the environment, initialise the wallets and create the actor using the comit-sdk's `createActor` function.
Note that we will use the Bitcoin and Ethereum account as well as the cnd instance with index `1` for the taker.

In the end our `taker.ts` file should look like this:

```typescript
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
import * as os from "os";
import * as path from "path";
import {createActor, EthereumWallet, InMemoryBitcoinWallet} from "comit-sdk";
import { formatEther } from "ethers/utils";

(async function main() {
    console.log("COMIT Taker app");

    const configPath = path.join(os.homedir(), ".create-comit-app", "env");
    dotenv.config({path: configPath});

    const bitcoinWallet = await InMemoryBitcoinWallet.newInstance(
        "regtest",
        process.env.BITCOIN_P2P_URI!,
        process.env[`BITCOIN_HD_KEY_${1}`]!
    );
    // Waiting for the Bitcoin wallet to read the balance
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000));

    const ethereumWallet = new EthereumWallet(
        process.env.ETHEREUM_NODE_HTTP_URL!,
        process.env[`ETHEREUM_KEY_${1}`]!
    );

    let taker = await createActor(
        bitcoinWallet,
        ethereumWallet,
        process.env[`HTTP_URL_CND_${1}`]!
    );

    console.log(
        "[Taker] Bitcoin balance: %f, Ether balance: %f",
        (await taker.bitcoinWallet.getBalance()).toFixed(2),
        parseFloat(
            formatEther(await taker.ethereumWallet.getBalance())
        ).toFixed(2)
    );

    process.exit();
})();
```

When running `yarn run taker` we should see:

```
yarn run v1.22.0
$ ts-node ./src/taker.ts
COMIT Taker app
[Taker] Bitcoin balance: 10, Ether balance: 1000
✨  Done in 9.34s.
```

## Implementation of negotiating a Swap

Now that both sides of the trade (maker and taker) are set up, let's start implementing the actual trade!

First we focus on the negotiation between maker and taker. 
The maker will create and publish an order that the taker can then find and take. 
Once the taker has taken the order the execution is triggered.

This tutorial uses the comit-js-sdk's [TakerNegotiator]() and [MakerNegotiator]() classes for negotiating the trade. 
This tutorial does not tackle the problem of "finding a trading partner".
It is assumed that the taker already knows how to reach the "order-server" of the maker.

### Maker creates an Order

### Maker publishes an Order

### Taker takes the Order
