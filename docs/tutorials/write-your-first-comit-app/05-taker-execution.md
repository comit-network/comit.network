## The execution on the taker side


Since the taker defaults to the role of Alice for the execution, the taker has to fund first. 
Since the order stated that the taker wants to get bitcoin for his ether the taker will have to find on the Ethereum side.
The maker's cnd node will start monitoring the Ethereum blockchain once the swap was initialised on the maker's side.
Once the taker funds on Ethereum the maker's cnd node will record this.
