By creating protocols for [Layer 2](#layer-2) integration, the time for swap execution can be significantly reduced.

## Layer 2

Layer 1 solutions are defined as blockchains with a consensus mechanism in place and a certain block-time. 

Layer 2 solutions build on top of Layer 1 solutions and enable instant off-line transactions.
Layer 2 solutions are bound to Layer 1 ledgers for settlement. 

Examples for layer 2 networks:

* [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/) on top of Bitcoin.
* [Raiden Network](https://raiden.network/) on top of Ethereum.
