[`create-comit-app`](https://github.com/comit-network/create-comit-app/) is a project to help COMIT App developers setup an environment.
In this documentation we'll run you through:
- How to use `create-comit-app`,
- What does `create-comit-app` do and how can it be useful to you, a COMIT App dev,
- How to run one the provided example, i.e., run an atomic swap with local blockchain nodes.

While mainly written in Rust, it is actually shipped on [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com) as two packages:
- [`create-comit-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-comit-app)
- [`comit-scripts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/comit-scripts)

While you can build your app in JavaScript, examples and the [SDK](https://github.com/comit-network/comit-js-sdk/) are written in TypeScript,
allowing you to also build in TypeScript.

To use either packages, you need to have [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.
In this tutorial we will use `yarn` but it can be replaced by `npm` in any command below. 

## TL;DR - Quick Start

```
yarn create comit-app my-app
cd my-app/demos/btc_eth
yarn install
yarn run start-env
```

Once it says the `Environment is ready`, open a new terminal (keep the current terminal running):

```
cd my-app/demos/btc_eth
yarn run swap
```

Congratulations, you did a Bitcoin to Ether atomic swap!

## Long version

 Let's have a look at [comit-scripts](#comit-scripts) before [running an demo](#run-a-demo) together.

### Run a demo

The template COMIT App comes with a number of examples and demo projects that allows you to get inspired and run atomic swap between the various supported assets.

Let's run one of those demos to see how an atomic swap execution looks like:

```
cd demos/btc_eth
yarn install
```
```
yarn install v1.21.1
[1/4] üîç  Resolving packages...
[2/4] üöö  Fetching packages...
[3/4] üîó  Linking dependencies...
[4/4] üî®  Building fresh packages...
‚ú®  Done in 72.77s.
```

If `start-env` from the previous section is still running, leave it. If not, you need to start it:
```
yarn run start-env
```
```
yarn run v1.21.1
$ comit-scripts start-env
First time execution, downloading comit-scripts 0.8.3...‚úì

üéâ Environment is ready, time to create a COMIT app!
‚úì
```

Then, from a new terminal:
```
cd my-app/demos/btc_eth
yarn run swap
```
```
yarn run v1.21.1
$ ts-node ./src/index.ts
