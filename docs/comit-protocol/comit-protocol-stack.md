<UnderConstruction />

This documentation section provides an introduction to the COMIT protocol stack.
Concepts specific to the COMIT protocol as well as the protocol design are explained here.

<ComitProtocolMotivationPresentation />

## Comit Network Daemon (cnd)

The [COMIT network daemon (cnd)](https://github.com/comit-network/comit-rs/) is the reference implementation of the COMIT protocol written in Rust.

## Protocols in COMIT

A protocol can be roughly defined as the order and semantics of actions.

Within COMIT, we have two kinds of protocols:

1. Cryptographic protocols
1. Communication protocols

A cryptographic protocol within COMIT defines the order and semantics of interactions with ledgers.
At the moment, COMIT specializes in cryptographic protocols that facilitate atomic swaps.

A communication protocol within COMIT defines how two COMIT nodes interact with each other.
Those (libp2p-based) protocols facilitate the exchange of information for the purpose of then following a cryptographic protocol.

### COMIT Cryptographic Protocols

The COMIT cryptographic protocols define protocols for executing an atomic swaps.
For the negotiation phase please refer to the [negotiation protocol section](#comit-negotiation-protocols).

The COMIT protocol distinguishes between ledgers and assets.
When referring to a ledger we use a an uppercase first letter (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum), when referring to an asset we use a lowercase first letter (e.g. bitcoin, ether).

COMIT currently defines the following atomic swap protocols:

* HAN - **H**TLCs for **A**ssets that are **N**ative to the ledger
* HErc20 - **H**TLCs for the **Erc20** asset
* HALight - **H**TLCs for **A**ssets on the **Light**ning ledger

Besides these protocols there is a protocol for [privacy preserving swaps](../core-concepts/privacy-preserving-swap.md) in [development](https://github.com/comit-network/grin-btc-poc). 

#### HAN

HAN stands for **H**TLCs for **A**ssets that are **N**ative to the ledger.

The HAN protocol currently supports the following assets:

* HAN for bitcoin on Bitcoin
* HAN for ether on Ethereum

#### HErc20

**H**TLCs for the **Erc20** asset

The HErc20 protocol supports the following asset:

* [Erc20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md) tokens on Ethereum

#### HALight

**H**TLCs for **A**ssets on the **Light**ning ledger

The HALight protocol is currently still in development, the first supported asset will be bitcoin on the Lightning network.

### COMIT Communication Protocols

The communication protocols of COMIT are used to exchange information between parties prior to the execution of a [swap](../core-concepts/atomic-swap-htlc.md).

The communication protocols in [cnd](#comit-network-daemon-cnd) are based on [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/).

### COMIT Negotiation Protocols

Currently the [COMIT network daemon (cnd)](https://github.com/comit-network/comit-rs/) does not support [negotiation](../core-concepts/negotiation.md) protocols.
However, the [Javascript SDK](../comit-sdk/index.md) includes a simple server-client negotiation protocol that shows how negotiation and execution can be combined in an application.

Note that you don't have to use the negotiation classes provided by the [Javascript SDK](../comit-sdk/index.md) when building an application on top of COMIT. 
Your application can introduce its own negotiation protocol instead.
