⚠️ Disclaimer: This part of the documentation is still under construction!

This documentation section provides an introduction into instant swaps.
The goal of instant swaps is to reduce the swap execution time.
One way to achieve instant swaps is to enable atomic swaps with [Layer 2 solutions](#layer-2-solutions).

## Layer 2 solutions

Layer 1 solutions are defined as blockchains with a consensus mechanism in place and a certain block-time. 

Layer 2 solutions build on top of Layer 1 solutions and enable instant off-chain transactions.
Layer 2 solutions are bound to Layer 1 ledgers for settlement. 

Examples for layer 2 networks:

* [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/) on top of Bitcoin.
* [Raiden Network](https://raiden.network/) on top of Ethereum.
